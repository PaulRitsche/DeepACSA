Description
-----------
This module contains functions to train a VGG16 encoder U-net decoder CNN.
The module was specifically designed to be executed from a GUI.
When used from the GUI, the module saves the trained model and weights to

mask directories. Instructions for correct image labelling can be found
in the Labelling directory.

def conv_block(inputs, num_filters: int):
    """
    Function to build a convolutional block for the U-net decoder path of the network to be build.
    The block is built using several keras.layers functionalities.

    Here, we decided to use 'padding = same' and and a convolutional kernel of 3.
    This is adaptable in the code but will influence the model outcome.
    The convolutional block consists of two convolutional layers. Each creates a convolution kernel
    that is convolved with the layer input to produce a tensor of outputs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    inputs : KerasTensor
        Concattenated Tensorflow.Keras Tensor outputted from previous layer. The Tensor can be
        altered by adapting, i.e. the filter numbers but this will change the model training output.
        The input is then convolved using the built kernel.
    num_filters : int
        Integer variable determining the number of filters used during model training.
        Here, we started with 'num_filers = 512'. The filter number is halfed each
        layer. The number of filters can be adapted in the code.
        Must be non-negative and non-zero.

    Returns
    -------
    x : KerasTensor
        Tensorflow.Keras Tensor used during model Training.
        The Tensor can be altered by adapting the input paramenters to the function or
        the upsampling but this will change the model training. The number of filters
        is halfed.

    Notes
    -----
    - The function applies two Conv2D layers with 3x3 kernel size and "same" padding.
    - After each convolutional layer, BatchNormalization is applied to normalize the activations.
    - ReLU activation is applied after each BatchNormalization layer.
    - The purpose of this block is to improve the feature representation and stability of training in deeper networks.

    Example
    -------
    >>> conv_block(inputs=KerasTensor(type_spec=TensorSpec(shape=(None, 256, 256, 128),
                   dtype=tf.float32, name=None),

def decoder_block(inputs, skip_features, num_filters):
    """
    Function to build a decoder block for the U-net decoder path of the network to be build.
    The block is build using several keras.layers functionalities.

    The block is built by applying a deconvolution (Keras.Conv2DTranspose) to upsample to input
    by a factor of 2. A concatenation with the skipped features from the mirrored
    vgg16 convolutional layer follows. Subsequently a convolutional block (see conv_block
    function) is applied to convolve the input with the built kernel.

    Parameters
    ----------
    inputs : KerasTensor
        Concattenated Tensorflow.Keras Tensor outputted from previous layer. The Tensor can be
        altered by adapting, i.e. the filter numbers but this will change the model training output.
    skip_features : Keras Tensor
        Skip connections to the encoder path of the vgg16 encoder.
    num_filters : int
        Integer variable determining the number of filters used during model training.
        Here, we started with 'num_filers = 512'. The filter number is halfed each
        layer. The number of filters can be adapted in the code. Must be non-neagtive and non-zero.

    Returns
    -------
    x : KerasTensor
        Tensorflow.Keras Tensor used during model Training. The tensor is upsampled using
        Keras.Conv2DTranspose with a kernel of (2,2), 'stride=2' and 'padding=same'.
        The upsampling increases image size by a factor of 2. The number of filters is halfed.
        The Tensor can be altered by adapting the input paramenters to the function or
        the upsampling but this will change the model training.

    Notes
    -----
    - The function applies a Conv2DTranspose layer with 2x2 kernel size and stride 2 to upsample the inputs.
    - The upsampled tensor is then concatenated with the skip connection tensor from the corresponding encoder block.
    - The concatenated tensor is passed through a pre-specified convolutional block defined by the 'conv_block' function.

    Function that builds a convolutional network consisting of an VGG16 encoder path
    and a U-net decoder path.

    The model is built using several Tensorflow.Keras functions. First, the whole VGG16
    model is imported and built using pretrained imagenet weights and the input shape.
    Then, the encoder layers are pulled from the model as well as the bridge part.
    Subsequently the decoder path from the U-net is built based on the VGG16 inputs.
    Lastly, a 1x1 convolution is applied with sigmoid activation to perform binary
    segmentation on the input.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_shape : tuple
        Tuple describing the input shape. Must be of shape (...,...,...).
        Here we used (512,512,3) as input shape. The image size (512,512,)

    The focal loss can be used as a loss metric during binary segmentation when

    Returns
    -------
    f_loss : tf.Tensor
        Tensor containing the calculated focal loss score.

    Notes
    -----
    - Focal Loss is defined as -alpha * (1 - p)^gamma * log(p), where p is the predicted probability
      for the positive class (y_pred) and (1 - p) is the predicted probability for the negative class.
    - The loss function focuses more on hard-to-classify examples (low-confidence predictions) due to
      the presence of the gamma term, which increases the loss for well-classified examples.
    - The alpha parameter controls the weight assigned to the positive class, with alpha = 0.5 giving
      equal weight to both classes and higher alpha values favoring the positive class.
