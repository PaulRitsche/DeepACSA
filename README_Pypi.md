# DeepACSA
*Automatic analysis of human lower limb ultrasonography images*

DeepACSA is an open-source tool to evaluate the anatomical cross-sectional area of muscles in ultrasound images using deep learning.
More information about the installtion and usage of DeepACSA can be found in the online [documentation](https://deepacsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). You can find information about contributing, issues and bug reports there as well.
If you find this work useful, please remember to cite the corresponding [paper](https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Abstract/9900/DeepACSA__Automatic_Segmentation_of.87.aspx), where more information about the model architecture and performance can be found as well. 

## Quickstart

To quickly start the DeepACSA either open the executable or type 

``python -m Deep_ACSA``

in your prompt once the package was installed and the DeepACSA environment activated.
